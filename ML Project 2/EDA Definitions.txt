Data Analysis can be organized into 6 types

  Exploratory Analysis
  Descriptive Analysis
  Inferential Analysis
  Predictive Analysis
  Causal Analysis
  Mechanistic Analysis

EDA-   Exploratory Analysis  (Univariate, Multivariate, KDE, Pearson Correlation)

What do you mean by EDA?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate 
data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods

Univariate Non-graphical: this is the simplest form of data analysis as during this we use just one 
variable to research the info. The standard goal of univariate non-graphical EDA is to know the underlying 
sample distribution/ data and make observations about the population.

Multivariate :
Graphical methods summarize the data in a diagrammatic or visual way. Univariate methods look at one variable (data column)
at a time, while multivariate methods look at two or more variables at a time to explore relationships. Usually, 
multivariate EDA will be bivariate (looking at exactly two variables).

KDE:
Kernel density estimation is a non-parametric model also know as KDE, it's a technique that lets you create a smooth curve given a set of data. 
KDE basically centers a kernel function at each data point and smooths it to get a destiny estimate.

Pearson Correlation:
Correlation coefficient formulas are used to find how strong a relationship is between data. 
The formulas return a value between -1 and 1, where:

1 indicates a strong positive relationship.
-1 indicates a strong negative relationship.
A result of zero indicates no relationship at all.
