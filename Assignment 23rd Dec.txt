Assignment:
Make Short Notes on ImageNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, Inception

Notes: 
Define ImageNet?
ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), 
in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.
The project has been instrumental in advancing computer vision and deep learning research.

ImageNet model?
ImageNet is a project which aims to provide a large image database for research purposes. 
It contains more than 14 million images which belong to more than 20,000 classes ( or synsets ).
They also provide bounding box annotations for around 1 million images, which can be used in Object Localization tasks.

Define AlexNet?
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is 8 layers deep.
You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. 
The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.

What is AlexNet architecture in CNN?
AlexNet architecture consists of 5 convolutional layers, 3 max-pooling layers, 2 normalization layers, 2 fully connected layers,
and 1 softmax layer. 2. Each convolutional layer consists of convolutional filters and a nonlinear activation function ReLU. 
The pooling layers are used to perform max pooling.

Define VGGNet?
VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers. 
The “deep” refers to the number of layers with VGG-16 or VGG-19 consisting of 16 and 19 convolutional layers.

Define ResNet?
Deep residual networks like the popular ResNet-50 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is 50 layers deep.

What is inception in deep learning?
An inception network is a deep neural network with an architectural design that consists of repeating components referred to
 as Inception modules. As mentioned earlier, this article focuses on the technical details of the inception module.

What is the main difference between VGG and AlexNet?
VGG, while based off of AlexNet, has several differences that separates it from other competing models: 
Instead of using large receptive fields like AlexNet (11x11 with a stride of 4), VGG uses very small receptive fields 
(3x3 with a stride of 1)
